# The main Idea of this Repository.
I created this repository to Show my progress as I continue in the Course. The goal is to separate the whole Java Masterclass for Software Developers course in 3 sections.

## First Part: Basic.
In this Repository I intend to Upload every possible Challenge in the `Java Masterclass for Software Developers` from section 1, the very begining of the course, until the Section 7 which is a good look at object-oriented programming and what I suppose is the end of the Basic part of the course.

### This is a Second version.

This is a Second Version of my first repository Uploaded to GitHub, I made this second one in order to be clearer, the other one was a mess and was very mixed up. So I created this one after I learned to use git in console that´s why there´s a huge difference in the dates of the Commits.
