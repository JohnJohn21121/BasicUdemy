# The main Idea of this Repository.
I created this repository to Show my progress as I continue in the Course. The goal is to separate the whole Java Masterclass for Software Developers course in 3 sections.

## First Part.
In this Repository I intend to Upload every possible Challenge in the `Java Masterclass for Software Developers` from section 1, the very begining of the course, until the Section 7 which is a good look at object-oriented programming and what I suppose is the end of the intermediate part of the course.

### Take a Look at the Course.
